Built on the AI SDK 5 alpha, the Gateway lets you switch between ~100 AI models without needing to manage API keys, rate limits, or provider accounts. The Gateway handles authentication, usage tracking, and in the future, billing.\\nGet started with AI SDK 5 and the Gateway, or continue reading to learn more. Why we’re building the AI Gateway The current speed of AI development is fast and is only getting faster. There\\'s a new state-of-the-art model released almost every week. Frustratingly, this means developers have been locked into a specific provider or model API in their application code. We want to help developers ship fast and keep up with AI progress, without needing 10 different API keys and provider accounts. Prod\\n...\\nWalter and Lars\\nMay 1\\niOS developers can now offer commission-free payments on web\\nYesterday, a federal court made a decisive ruling in Epic Games v. Apple: Apple violated a 2021 injunction by continuing to restrict developers from linking to external payment methods, and by imposing a 27% fee when they did. The ruling represents a major shift for native app developers.\\nWhy does it matter? Apple’s App Store has operated as a tightly controlled marketplace. Until now, developers couldn’t even tell users they could pay elsewhere. Apple’s 30% cut (the so-called \"Apple Tax\") meant higher prices for consumers, smaller margins for developers, and less freedom overall. After the 2021 injunction, Apple introduced a system called StoreKit External Purchase Link API. This surfaced a system disclosure sheet, a \"scare screen,\" warning users that they were about to leave th\\n...\\nFernando Rojo\\nJun 4\\nThe no-nonsense approach to AI agent development\\nAI agents are software systems that take over tasks made up of manual, multi-step processes. These often require context, judgment, and adaptation, making them difficult to automate with simple rule-based code. While traditional automation is possible, it usually means hardcoding endless edge cases. Agents offer a more flexible approach. They use context to decide what to do next, reducing manual effort on tedious steps while keeping a review process in place for important decisions. The most effective AI agents are narrow, tightly scoped, and domain-specific.  Here\\'s how to approach building one.\\nMalte Ubl\\nLatest news.\\nCustomers\\nJun 16\\nTray.ai cut build times from a day to minutes with Vercel\\nTray.ai is a composable AI integration and automation platform that enterprises use to build smart, secure AI agents at scale. To modernize their marketing site, they partnered with Roboto Studio to migrate off their legacy solution and outdated version of Next.js. The goal: simplify the architecture, consolidate siloed repos, and bring content and form management into one unified system. After moving to Vercel, builds went from a full day to just two minutes.\\nPeri Langlois\\nEngineering\\nJun 12\\nBuilding efficient MCP servers\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how to build integrations for AI models. We built the MCP adapter to help developers create their own MCP servers using popular frameworks such as Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit. Production apps like Zapier, Composio, Vapi, and Solana use the MCP adapter to deploy their own MCP servers on Vercel, and they\\'ve seen substantial growth in the past month.  MCP has been adopted by popular clients like Cursor, Claude, and Windsurf. These now support connecting to MCP servers and calling tools. Companies create their own MCP servers to make their tools available in the ecosystem. The growing adoption of MCP shows its importance, but scaling MCP servers reveals limitations in the original design. Let\\'s look at how the MCP specification has evolved, and how the MCP adapter can help.\\nAndrew Qu\\nGeneral\\nJun 11\\nDesigning and building the Vercel Ship conference platform\\nOur two conferences (Vercel Ship and Next.js Conf) are our chance to show what we\\'ve been building, how we\\'re thinking, and cast a vision of where we\\'re going next.  It\\'s also a chance to push ourselves to create an experience that builds excitement and reflects the quality we strive for in our products. For Vercel Ship 2025, we wanted that experience to feel fluid and fast. This is a look at how we made the conference platform and visuals, from ferrofluid-inspired 3D visuals and generative AI workflows, to modular component systems and more.\\n+2\\nGenny, Daniel, and 2 others\\nGeneral\\nJun 10\\nHow we’re adapting SEO for LLMs and AI search\\nSearch is changing. Backlinks and keywords aren’t enough anymore. AI-first interfaces like ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews now answer questions before users ever click a link (if at all). Large language models (LLMs) have become a new layer in the discovery process, reshaping how, where, and when content is seen. This shift is changing how visibility works. It’s still early, and nobody has all the answers. But one patte'"
